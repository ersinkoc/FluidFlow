Checkbox morphing: square to checkmark using SVG path animation or clip-path transition. Toggle switch: circle to rectangle with border-radius animation. Complex morphs: use Lottie animations for designer-created morphs, or GSAP MorphSVG plugin for path morphing. CSS approach: use clip-path transitions for simpler shape morphs.

Tools: browser devtools accessibility panel, WebAIM Contrast Checker, Stark plugin, axe DevTools. Common violations to fix: light gray text on white (text-gray-400 on white fails - use text-gray-600+), colored text on colored backgrounds (blue on purple), placeholder text (often too light), disabled states (still need to be perceivable). Links: must be distinguishable from surrounding text by more than color (add underline, font-weight, or icon), visited vs unvisited distinction. Mode testing: verify in both light and dark modes, ensure theme toggle doesn\'t break contrast. Focus indicators: ring color must contrast with background. Beyond color: never use color alone to convey meaning (add icons, text, patterns for errors, status, required fields). Colorblind considerations: test with Sim Daltonism or browser extensions, avoid red/green only distinctions, use patterns or shapes as backup. Interactive states: hover, active, focus states all need sufficient contrast. Disabled elements: use opacity-50 or similar but ensure still perceivable (don\'t rely on color to show disabled).

Why focus-visible: shows focus on keyboard navigation but not mouse click, better UX while maintaining accessibility. Contrast requirements: focus indicator needs 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors, on all backgrounds (light, dark, images, gradients). Consistency: apply same focus style across all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, custom controls), consider creating Tailwind @apply class for reuse. Custom components: cards (entire card focusable if clickable), images (in galleries/carousels), custom switches/checkboxes (ensure ring visible around control), dropdown triggers, accordions. Dark mode: adjust ring-offset-gray-900 or ring-white for visibility on dark backgrounds. Ring offset importance: offset creates separation from element edge, making indicator visible regardless of element background. Custom form controls: native inputs have built-in focus, but custom replacements need explicit styling. Never: remove outline without replacement (outline-none alone is accessibility fail), use color-only focus indicators (must have shape change). Testing: Tab through entire application, verify focus visible everywhere, test at 200% zoom (focus shouldn\'t be cropped), test on varied backgrounds.

Implementation: <a href="#main-content" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only ...">Skip to main content</a> as first child of body or layout. Multiple skip links for complex pages: "Skip to navigation" (for mega menus), "Skip to search" (prominent search), "Skip to footer" (contact info). Skip link group: if multiple, show as a row of links on focus (first link receives focus, Tab moves through group). Target considerations: tabindex="-1" on non-interactive targets (main, section), ensures focus moves without adding to tab order. Testing: press Tab immediately after page load, skip link should be first thing focused and visible, clicking should move focus past navigation. Responsive: on mobile with drawer navigation, skip link less critical but still valuable. Scroll behavior: browser should scroll target into view, consider scroll-margin-top if fixed header.
