Show/hide animation: smooth height animation using grid-template-rows or max-height transition, opacity fade, prevent layout shift. Visibility tracking: track visible fields in state, update when dependencies change. Validation scope: only validate currently visible fields, clear or preserve hidden field errors. Value handling on hide: optionally clear values when field hidden (configurable), preserve values if might show again. Nested dependencies: A shows B, B shows C - handle cascading visibility. Required fields: conditionally required based on other values. Complex logic: support expressions ("if A=1 AND (B=2 OR C=3)"). React Hook Form integration: use watch() to track trigger fields, conditionally render with animations. Performance: memoize condition evaluation, avoid re-renders on unrelated changes. Initial state: evaluate conditions on mount for correct initial visibility. Read-only mode: conditions should work in both edit and view modes. Debugging: dev mode indicator showing why fields are shown/hidden. Section visibility: apply conditions to entire sections, not just individual fields.
