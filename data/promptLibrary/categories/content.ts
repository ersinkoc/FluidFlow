        advanced: 'Create contextual help tooltip system for user guidance. Trigger element: HelpCircle or Info icon (h-4 w-4 text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600), placed after form labels or near complex UI. Trigger behavior: show on mouseenter (with 150ms delay to prevent flicker), show on focus for keyboard, hide on mouseleave (with 200ms delay to allow moving to tooltip). Tooltip container: position absolute/fixed, z-50, bg-gray-900 text-white text-sm, py-2 px-3, rounded-lg, max-w-xs, shadow-lg. Arrow: CSS triangle using ::after pseudo-element, positioned pointing to trigger. Positioning: default above/below trigger, flip automatically based on viewport edges (use floating-ui or @radix-ui/tooltip). Rich content: support multiple lines, bold text, links (in light color), bullet lists, even inline code. Interactive tooltip: if contains links or interactive elements, keep open while user hovers tooltip. Animation: fade in (opacity transition) and slight translate for polish. Keyboard support: show when trigger focused (with Tab), dismiss on Escape key, not blocking focus flow. Touch devices: tap to show, tap elsewhere to dismiss, or tap toggle. Accessibility: trigger has aria-describedby pointing to tooltip id, tooltip has role="tooltip". Alternative: for longer help content, use help modal or slide-out panel instead of tooltip. Implementation: Radix UI Tooltip, Floating UI, or custom hook. Dark mode: consider inverting colors (bg-white text-gray-900) for dark backgrounds. Help icon consistency: use same icon throughout app for discoverability.'
